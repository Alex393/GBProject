# GBProject

Purpose of the project:
Currently a studnet trying to learn how to make an emulator for the purpose of improving my coding knowledge

Feature I want it to have:
- Play GBA ROMs on your computer
- Supports basic graphics rendering (tile-based graphics)
- Input support via keyboard (A, B, Start, Select, D-pad)
- Save/load state functionality (save your game progress)
- Simple and lightweight design
